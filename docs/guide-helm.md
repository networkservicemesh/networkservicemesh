# Using Helm to install NSM on kubernetes cluster

This document will show you how to use `Helm` for `NSM` installation. 

## Helm installation
[Helm Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#quickstart-guide)

## Useful Helm commands
* `$ helm install CHART` - install specified chart on cluster
* `$ helm ls` - list of deployed releases and their states
* `$ helm uninstall RELEASE_NAME` - delete release

## 

## Using Helm for NSM installation

Installing NSM with helm in the `nsm-system` namespace is as easy as:

```bash
$ helm install nsm deployments/helm/nsm
```

## Using Helm to install examples
After installation of NSM on cluster you can install examples to check correctness of cluster configuration.

Install simple NSC and icmp-responder:
```bash
$ helm install endpoint deployments/helm/endpoint
$ helm install client deployments/helm/client
```

Install vppagent-nsc and vppagent-icmp-responder:
```bash
$ helm install vpp-icmp-responder deployments/helm/vpp-icmp-responder
```

Install vpn-gateway-nsc, vpp-gateway-nse and vppagent-firewall-nse:
```bash
$ helm install vpn deployments/helm/vpn
```

Install crossconnect-monitor:
```bash
$ helm install crossconnect-monitor deployments/helm/crossconnect-monitor
```

Install skydive:
```bash
$ helm install skydive deployments/helm/skydive
```

Install jaeger:
```bash
$ helm install jaeger deployments/helm/jaeger
```

## Values specification
Every chart has file `values.yaml`. Now there is a possibility to specify docker registry and tag for images in this file:

```yaml
registry: docker.io
org: networkservicemesh
tag: master
```

## Makefile integration

For developers' and testing convenience, we have added a number of make targets to support helm chart deployments.
Initialisation of Helm, including the creation fo the service account for tiller is wrapped in `make helm-init`.
The targets to deploy software are in the form `helm-install-<chart>` and `helm-delete-<chart>`. For example a basic NSM infra installation can be achieved by issuing `make helm-install-nsm` in the root folder. It will use the default values except for `org` and `tag` which can be overwritten by setting `CONTAINER_REPO` (defaults to `networkservicemesh`) and `CONTAINER_TAG` (defaults to `latest`). The defaults allow for easy local development. Cleaning up is also easy with the `make helm-delete-nsm` command.
